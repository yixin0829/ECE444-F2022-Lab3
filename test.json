Topics to be covered include: mediated reality, Personal Safety Devices, lifelong personal video capture, the Eye Tap principle, collinearity criterion, comparametric equations, photoquantigraphic imaging, lightvector spaces, anti-homomorphic imaging, application of personal imaging to the visual arts, and algebraic projective geometry.","67":"Focuses on power electronic converters utilized in applications ranging from low-power mobile devices to higher power applications such as electric vehicles, server farms, microgrids, and renewable energy systems. Concepts covered include the principles of efficient electrical energy processing (dc-dc, dc\/ac, and ac\/ac) through switch-mode energy conversion, converter loss analysis, large- and small-signal modeling of power electronic circuits and controller design.","68":"Presents the concepts of short-circuit fault analysis, protective relaying, and automation in power systems. The course starts by discussing the causes and types of short-circuit faults using real-world examples. The consequences of faults for different power system components will be reviewed using event reports from field data. The method of symmetrical components for analyzing unbalanced three-phase systems will be introduced. Analytical methods and computer-based approaches for deriving fault voltages and currents will be discussed and the effect of system grounding during transient conditions, including faults, will be introduced. Students will also learn the concept of power system automation and its role in monitoring, protection. and control of modern power systems. Critical devices used in an automation system, such as breakers, relays, reclosers, capacitor bank controllers, and tap changer controllers will be presented.","69":"Advanced digital systems design concepts including project planning, design flows, embedded processors, hardware\/software interfacing and interactions, software drivers, embedded operating systems, memory interfaces, system-level timing analysis, clocking and clock domains. A significant design project is undertaken and implemented on an FPGA development board.","70":"Introduction to the principles and properties of random processes, with applications to communications, control systems, and computer science. Random vectors, random convergence, random processes, specifying random processes, Poisson and Gaussian processes, stationarity, mean square derivatives and integrals, ergodicity, power spectrum, linear systems with stochastic input, mean square estimation, Markov chains, recurrence, absorption, limiting and steady-state distributions, time reversibility, and balance equations.","71":"As computers permeate our society, the security of such computing systems is becoming of paramount importance. This course covers principles of computer systems security. To build secure systems, one must understand how attackers operate. This course starts by teaching students how to identify security vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited. Then techniques to create secure systems and defend against such attacks will be discussed. Industry standards for conducting security audits to establish levels of security will be introduced. The course will include an introduction to basic cryptographic techniques as well as hardware used to accelerate cryptographic operations in ATM's and webservers.","72":"As computers permeate our society, the security of such computing systems is becoming of paramount importance.
